Algorithm Design 

User: Anyone on this planet with a digital presence who experiences negative emotions like sadness or anxiety of varying degrees at different points of time. Everyone in the above bracket is a user irrespective of presence or absence of disease or treatment. 

Problem: User does not have a quick and low effort way to solve negative emotions as and when they arise. The existing solutions (a) focus on overall general wellbeing over a period of time and not on solving every individual instance/being there when they happen and (b) expect a lot of user motivation and involvement which is not realistic

Goal: To alleviate negative emotions of users whenever experienced quickly with minimal user effort using technology and data. Once successful, focus on preventing onset of similar negative emotions altogether in future. 

Methodology: To be done in two steps using ML. First is an auto identification of the onset of negative emotion based on nuanced changes in user behaviour detected digitally (reduction in phone click rate, app opens etc). Second is elimination of above by immediately providing favourable counter stimuli (favourite song, call from loved one etc) either pre determined by user or identified from data. Once successful, introduce nudges based on results of above to move on to the prevention solution. 

Key Challenges: Has to be very effective to not be discarded as gimmick. Has to adapt to every user's personal preferences.
